Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a third-year M.E. student in Mechanical Engineering at the [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](http://pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/index.html). I received my B.E. degree in Robotics Engineering from Peking University in 2023.

My research centers on the synergy between Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models, focusing on three key directions:

- **RL for LLMs**: Developing data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance post-training effectiveness, aiming to improve model performance and alignment with human preferences;

- **Agentic RL**: Designing novel RL methods to advance autonomous agent capabilities, with a particular emphasis on self-play mechanisms that push the boundaries of agent performance through adversarial and self-improvement training;

- **LLMs for Optimization**: Leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models to tackle complex optimization modeling and decision-making problems.

I have interned at two leading AI companies. At [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/pepper-spray-lipstick.html?cps=6bo8b0ce&bm=cps&src=saf&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20938423336&gbraid=0AAAAAqukZgrfH6pgy6bm7gNT0ece6Z_T0&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrtfNxremkAMV2DxECB3InSZeEAAYASAAEgKqjPD_BwE)’s QuarkLLM team(2025.05-2025.09), I contributed to the Deep Search project, designing RL algorithms to strengthen the Deep Search agent's performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and complex retrieval . Previously, at [Moonshot AI ](https://www.moonshot.cn/)(202501-2025.05), I worked on data synthesis and RL training for their WebAgent.
