## ABOUT ME

I'm currently an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering (Industrial Engineering Management) at Peking University, where I focus on **LLM for Optimization** and **Agentic Reinforcement Learning**. I'm also doing my internship at Alibaba QuarkLLM. Previously I was an intern at Moonshot AI RL Team. I received my B.S. degree in Robotics Engineering from Peking University in 2023.

My research interests recently focus on **Agentic RL**, **Multi-Agent systems**, and **Self-Play training methodologies** for enhancing LLM agent capabilities. Previously I was working on optimization algorithms and mathematical modeling for LLMs. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive experience in **LLM for Optimization**, particularly in **Optimization Modeling**, and **Agentic RL training** methodologies.
