I am currently a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the College of Engineering, Peking University, where I focus on **optimization algorithms**, **large language models**, and **LLM4OPT** research. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering at Peking University in 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory and artificial intelligence, particularly in applying large language models to optimization problems. I am passionate about developing novel algorithms that can bridge the gap between traditional optimization methods and modern AI techniques.

I have gained valuable industry experience as a **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Engineer** through internships at leading AI companies. Most recently, I worked at **Alibaba Group's Quark division** (May-September 2025) on large model training and applications, and previously at **Moonshot AI (Kimi)** (January-May 2025) on the WebAgent project, where I developed RL algorithms for web-based autonomous agents.

My technical expertise spans machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), optimization tools (CPLEX, Gurobi, OR-Tools), and programming languages (Python, C++, MATLAB). I am always interested in collaborating on projects related to optimization algorithms, reinforcement learning, and AI applications.
